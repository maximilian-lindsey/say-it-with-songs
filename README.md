# Next + Netlify Starter

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/40d4e2f5-a6a2-40e6-a222-5b9016b2e46a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/zealous-curran-4ad28f/deploys)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v12 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/SyTBPVamO)!

This project is a very minimal starter that includes 2 sample components, a global stylesheet, a `netlify.toml` for deployment, and a `jsconfig.json` for setting up absolute imports and aliases. It also includes the [Essential Next.js Build Plugin](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs), which will allow for you to implement features like Preview Mode, server-side rendering/incremental static regeneration via Netlify Functions, and internationalized routing.

(If you click this button, it will create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify)
